    text: `Not all living things are created by someone's plan. Sometimes it's just pure coincidence. The research activity of the science station on the planet Shroud was to analyze the planet's surface and its moons. A young mycologist William Lang tried to breed a new species of spores by crossing terrestrial species with local species. Unfortunately, his experiments failed each time, and the only thing he succeeded in was growing a simple earth fungus in the soil of a new planet. It took on red and orange hues and nothing more.
    After the disappearance of Mankind, The Fungus did not wait for its creator. However, the favorable atmosphere at the station and the availability of nutrients helped the Fungus to grow, as a result, the earth mushroom began to grow throughout the station.`,
